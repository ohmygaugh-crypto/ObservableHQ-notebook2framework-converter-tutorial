# Observable convertor tool guidance

Due to differences between Observable Framework and Observable notebooks, the convert command typically won’t produce a working Markdown page out of the box; you’ll often need to make further edits to the generated Markdown. We describe these differences below, along with examples of manual conversion.

The convert command has minimal “magic” so that its behavior is easier to understand and because converting notebook code into standard Markdown and JavaScript requires human interpretation. Still, we’re considering making convert smarter; let us know if you’re interested.

JavaScript syntax
Framework uses vanilla JavaScript syntax while notebooks use a nonstandard dialect called Observable JavaScript. A JavaScript cell in a notebook is technically not a JavaScript program (i.e., a sequence of statements) but rather a cell declaration; it can be either an expression cell consisting of a single JavaScript expression (such as 1 + 2) or a block cell consisting of any number of JavaScript statements (such as console.log("hello");) surrounded by curly braces. These two forms of cell require slightly different treatment. The convert command converts both into JavaScript fenced code blocks.

# My experience with the convertor tool:

So basically, I learned from the last framework conversiton is that. It took a day to convert the notebook to a framework page without the convertor tool. Arguing with claude the whole time. Then I glued it together with some javascript in the index.md file. Not sure if that is ideal. Especially, having to paste each code block into the a file manually.

Then with this convertor tool:

I was able to convert the notebook to a framework page in immediately. Then to get it working it took another 30 minutes.

This convertor cli tool snags all the notebook code snippets/blocks and puts them in the .md file.

The convertor tool didn't even make a data folder. Just two json files. It didn't follow typically observable framework structure. 

I ran this command intially:

```
npx @observablehq/framework@latest convert <notebook-url>
```
Then, I had to add a 2 package.json files. 
1) to the root of the project to get observable framework setup
2) to the src folder to get the components to work

Then running the following command to install the dependencies.

```
pnpm install
```


I ran gpt-4.5-turbo preview to convert the notebook into a framework page using the cursor Agent. I had followed the typical observable framework dir structure manually.
